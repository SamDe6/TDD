# The Clock
 
The top two rows of lamps are red. These indicate the hours of a day. In the top row there are 4 red lamps. Every lamp
represents 5 hours. In the lower row of red lamps every lamp represents 1 hour. So if two lamps of the first row and
three of the second row are switched on that indicates 5+5+3=13h or 1 pm.

## The brief

We have created a number of acceptance tests for the Clock and your challenge is to get them passing.

## Some hints
If you are new to Gradle, it may be worth spending 10 minutes reading a high level summary.  We are using the Gradle
Wrapper so `gradlew` from the command line should download everything you need.  Most modern IDEs support Maven projects.

Please ensure that you are familiar with our values in the instructions project.  They are important to us.
